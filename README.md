# cube-gallery

This was just an exploration of HTML5 
The 3dimensional box is rotated either clockwise or anti-clockwise depending on which side panel is clicked.
The photos are dynamically added to the cube in a set order using javascript. 
Video is in the background.
Border shadow and radial gradients along with animation create a glowing effect for the orb.
Clicking on each face of the cube will make it disappear.
Using the transparency slider you can adjust the opacity of the entire cube.
